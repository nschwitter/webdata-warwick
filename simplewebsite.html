<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<h2>This is a smaller heading</h2>
<h3>This is an even smaller heading</h3>

<!-- Help me, I'm trapped. -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

This is more text, even though it is not starting with those &lt; p &gt; tags. HTML text does not need to be in tags. 

<div> This is a sentence in a &lt; div &gt; container. They mark a new section. </div>

<div> This is another section. I'm not ending it with the end tags, but this is not a problem for a browser: They are quite equipped to handle sloppy HTML.


<div> Many HTML tags can be nested. <p> This is a paragraph within a div. </p> We can do lists:
<ul>
<li>This is the first item of an unordered list. 
<li id="secondlistitem"> This is the second item. I gave it an ID.  
</ul>

 </div>
